# oral_exam_notes
This is a (safe) space for me to organize my reading list and take notes on the papers. 

Some things to look at: [source](https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2019/04/29/how-to-prepare-for-qualifying-exams-or-how-to-read-too-many-books-in-seven-months/)

- When the book was published – copyright page
- The core argument of the book – the introduction or conclusion, often can be found with a sentence that starts with the words “in this book…”
- The way that each chapter contributes to that argument – table of contents, chapter breakdown in the introduction, in many academic books the - author will have a section in the introduction where they’ll provide short summaries of each chapter
- The way this book started/contributed to/challenged its field – read the quotes from other scholars on the book jacket, authors will often spell out their contribution in the introduction
- Core historical subjects/theorists/organizations/objects – look at the index
- What this book doesn’t do – take the introduction, conclusion, and table of contents and consider what is missing
- The primary sources being used in the book – footnotes/endnotes/bibliography
- The secondary sources being used in the book – footnotes/endnotes/bibliography
